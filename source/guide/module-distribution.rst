Module distribution
###################

Modules are distributed as ``.iom`` files, which may be encrypted. Designer has a tool to create encrypted ``.iom`` files from a module source package.

Designer creates a folder in the user's documents: |IO modules path in Documents|. Any ``*.iom`` files in this folder are automatically loaded by Designer on launch.
